            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>RADICAL EFFECTS OF SMOKING</p><p>The real danger of smoking is that smoking harms your body every time you light up.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">Researchers are not exactly sure how smoking causes so much damage, but they do agree that the free radicals and oxidation produced from smoking lead to disease.</span></p><p><br></p><p>SMOKER'S INSURANCE</p><p>Unfortunately, smoking dramatically depletes the antioxidants in your body, so it's important to get enough of these potent vitamins and nutrients to counteract free radical damage.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow our guidelines to protect and heal your body as you recover from smoking addiction.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>To heal your body from the damage related to smoking:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>1. Get vitamin E. Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant that can slow the progression of atherosclerosis. Cooked kale is a great source of dietary E.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Be like Popeye and eat your spinach. Spinach and other dark leafy greens have beta-carotene, an antioxidant that can protect you from cancer.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Drink antioxidant green tea. Green tea antioxidants, like polyphenols, fight aging and disease. There are many antioxidant-rich foods and green tea antioxidants are just one more way to easily get your dose of good health.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Take vitamin C. Smokers need two to three times the daily requirement of vitamin C just to maintain normal levels in their bodies.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Find a B-complex supplement with niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin, thiamine, folic acid, and biotin. These B vitamins are rich in antioxidants that protect your cells.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>6. Introduce fermented foods and drinks into your diet. fermented foods, like cultured vegetablesand fermented drinks, like Coco-Biotic are full of vitamins and minearls. They aid digestion, boost immunity AND can help you absorb the nutrients and antioxidants from your diet.</p><p><br></p><p>7. Try adaptogens, like holy basil and ashwaganda. These herbs have the ability to help your body recover from stress and give you energy. Since smoking often relieves stress emotionally and creates stress in your body, you may find that taking adaptogens helps with emotional AND physical stress relief.</p><p><br></p><p>8. Cleanse your body of heavy metals. Cigarettes contain all kinds of toxic substances, especially the heavy metal cadmium.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>9. Remove the root cause of stress, addictions and symptoms in your body and life by tapping into subconscious suppressed emotions. </p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://menutritious.com/recipe/zxNN8/badeel?userId=192V">Check out our healthiest recipe!</a></p></div>
